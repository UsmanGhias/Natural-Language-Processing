### Introduction to NLP and Its Applications
We'll kick off by exploring what NLP is and its wide-ranging applications in various fields, from chatbots to sentiment analysis.

### Deep Learning in NLP
Discover how deep learning techniques have revolutionized NLP, allowing us to tackle complex language tasks with remarkable accuracy.

### Key NLP Tasks
Get acquainted with fundamental NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and named entity recognition.

### Text Data Preprocessing Techniques
Learn the art of preparing text data for NLP analysis. We'll cover essential techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, text normalization, and text standardization.

### Parsing in NLP
Delve into the world of parsing and its role in NLP. We'll explore both dependency parsing and constituency parsing.

### Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching
Master the use of regular expressions and pattern matching to extract valuable information during text data preprocessing.

### NLP Datasets
Familiarize yourself with commonly used NLP datasets and the specific tasks they are designed for.

### Popular NLP Libraries
Explore the leading NLP libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and TextBlob that simplify NLP tasks and accelerate your work.

### Text Similarity and Distance
Understand how text similarity and distance metrics can quantify the similarity between textual documents.

### Corpus and Corpus Linguistics
Uncover the concept of a corpus and its importance in linguistic research, which forms the basis of many NLP applications.

### N-Grams in NLP
Learn about N-grams, a fundamental concept in NLP, and understand their significance in language modeling and analysis.

### Data Annotation and Labeling
Dive into data annotation and labeling, essential for training machine learning models in NLP.

### Text Data Characteristics
Differentiate between structured and unstructured text data and understand their roles in NLP tasks.
