## Introduction to Neural Networks and Its Architecture

Learn about the basics of neural networks, their architecture, and the various components that make up a neural network. Understand the role of layers, neurons, and weights in neural networks.

## First Neural Network using Keras

Get hands-on experience by building your first neural network using the Keras framework. Load and prepare data, define the network architecture, compile the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

## Deep Dive into Neural Networks

Delve deeper into neural networks by exploring perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), activation functions, backpropagation, gradient descent, overfitting, regularization, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more.
