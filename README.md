- **Text Generation:** Unleash the potential of language models for text generation, from chatbots to content creation.

- **Zero-shot Learning:** Understand how NLP models generalize to new tasks, even without explicit training.

## Getting Started

Ready to embark on your NLP journey with COD Crafters? Here's how to get started:

1. **Explore the Weekly Structure:** Begin with Week 1 and progressively advance through the weeks to build a strong NLP foundation.

2. **Access Resources:** Dive into articles, code examples, and projects within each week's dedicated folder.

3. **Contribute:** If you have valuable insights or resources to share, we encourage you to contribute to the repository. Your contributions can benefit the entire NLP community.

## Key Concepts

NLP is rich with terminology and concepts. To make the most of this repository, here are some key terms to be familiar with:

- **Word Embeddings:** Techniques to represent words as numerical vectors to enable mathematical operations on text data.

- **Language Models:** Systems that predict the probability of a sequence of words, essential for text generation and understanding.

- **Attention Mechanisms:** Mechanisms that allow models to focus on specific parts of input data, enhancing their understanding of context.

- **Zero-shot Learning:** The ability of models to perform tasks they haven't been explicitly trained for, a testament to their generalization capabilities.
